A simple, interactive To-Do list application built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This app allows users to manage their tasks, apply filters, and toggle between light and dark modes.

- **Search**: Search through tasks by typing in the search bar.
- **Filters**: Filter tasks by All, Active, or Completed states.

- **Local Storage**: Tasks and theme preferences are saved to Local Storage to persist even after a page refresh.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the app.
- **CSS**: For styling and theming (light/dark mode).
